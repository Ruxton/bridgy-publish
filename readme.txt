[Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy) Publish Interface for your Site

== Description == 

People often post something on their web site, then post a copy elsewhere so that other people will see it.

[Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publishing) is a service that will create a post on the appropriate site(Twitter, Facebook, Flickr). It 
generates the post by reading the HTML of your site. This means that the post is generates depends on your theme and any content generated by plugin.
Bridgy offers a preview mode on their site to test your theme.

This plugin is only a user interface for the Bridgy service and requires the [webmention](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/) plugin to notify Bridgy
to post. It also stores a link to the syndicated version for display by [Syndication Links](https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/) or other uses.

Development/Issues/Feature Requests for the plugin only should be submitted through [Github](https://github.com/dshanske/bridgy-publish).

For development/issues/enhancements for the Brid.gy service, please submit on their [Github](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy) page. Please read their About page 
for the features of the service prior to submission.
