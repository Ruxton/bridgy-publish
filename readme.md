Bridgy Publish Support for your Site

## Description ##

People often post something on their web site, then post a link to it on Facebook or Twitter so that other people will see it. The IndieWeb community calls this POSSE.

Bridgy Publish adds a hidden link to your post, and sends a webmention to Bridgy, which will create a post on the appropriate site.
